{"name":"Portfolio","tagline":"","body":"## Welcome T.J. Trimble's GitHub Portfolio.\r\n\r\nWith an eclectic background in innovation, computer science, operations, and customer service, I have a drive towards goal oriented, team-based innovation and research strategies. I believe in ownership, learning on the fly, and thinking big. I understand that innovation is a drive to simplicity and celebration of people. I believe technology is a bridge to connect users with new experiences, enabling the best in people.\r\n\r\n## What I do\r\n\r\n### Natural Language Processing: \r\nRule Based Methods: Multilingual implementation of adjectives in HPSG, small HPSG grammar of Penobscot, various FST and Regular Expression NLP tasks, English Resource Grammar-derived coreference resolution, and speaker identification.\r\nStochastic Methods: State of the art POS tagging, text classifying, and more with MaxEnt, SVM, Naive Bayes, KNN, and more.\r\n\r\n### Programming:\r\nPython 2+ years <br>\r\nPHP 4+ years <br>\r\nJava/Scala \\<1 year <br>\r\nHTML/CSS/Javascript 4+ years <br>\r\nSQL 3+ years <br>\r\nMallet, NLTK, FST 1+ years <br>\r\nCondor & Hadoop 1+ years <br>\r\n\r\n#### The Grammar Matrix:\r\n##### Adjectives\r\nImplementing a multilingual, broad typological coverage library implementing attributive and predicative adjectives in the LinGO Grammar Matrix in order to help jump start grammar development. Focused on typological coverage, elegant HPSG analyses, and great user interfaces and usability.\r\n##### Penobscot\r\nImplemented a small grammar of a morphologically complex, polysynthetic native American language: Penobscot. Deep understanding of morphologically complex languages, including noun and adjective incorporation, complex agreement patterns, and morpheme position class patterns, including strong morphophonological interactions.\r\n\r\n## What I have done\r\n### University of Washington\r\n#### Professional Masters of Science in Computational Linguistics\r\nStudied rule based and stochastic approaches to a variety of Natural Language Processing problems, including parsing, POS tagging, coreference resolution, and text classification.\r\n\r\n### The Apple Store\r\n#### Inventory Specialist\r\nDepartment manager overseeing inventory and operations at a major retail store. Mentoring, customer service, database management, visual merchandising, and more.\r\n\r\n### Trinity United Methodist Church\r\n#### Server Admin and Administrative Assistant\r\nSetting up and maintaining onsite server for web hosting, centralized file hosting, and software updates. General office management, document creation, database management, tech support, and more.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
